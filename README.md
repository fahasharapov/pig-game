Gameplay. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

Also, a player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
